# Cognitive Capacity Prediction based on MHAS data 

Licence: MIT

This README is in draft, more detail to follow.

Building on my [earlier work](https://github.com/nicknettleton/PREPARE-Challenge) in the [NIH/DrivenData PREPARE Challenge](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/300/competition-nih-alzheimers-sdoh-2/page/928/) competition,
the model aims to improvide prediction of future cognitive capacity based on social determinants
using data collected in the [Mexican Health & Aging Study](https://www.mhasweb.org/Home/index.aspx) since 2003.
